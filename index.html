                        <p>

                        &emsp; As a result of the advances in genetic engineering, the process of inserting desired genetic information into crops has become possible. Since it’s first applications, genetic modification of crops has consistently been an exceedingly controversial topic. In this project, our group attempts to do two things. First; perform an analysis to evaluate the potential effects of the genetic modification of crops on the Genuine Progress Index. Second; determine whether 
the practice of genetically modifying crops is a redemptive one under Franklin’s framework. 
                        <br>&emsp; Under the topic of bio-engineering and genetic modification (last topic of the ten), our group decided to choose genetic modification of crops as our practice for analysis. To clarify; although the title of our project contains the acronym GMO, our group is specifically referring to the cultivation and use of genetically modified foods (and not genetically modified organisms themselves). There are several reasons why this technology was chosen. In popular culture, consumers use the term GMO (genetically modified organism) to refer to genetically modified foods and despite the apparent safety and benefits of genetically modified foods, the general public “is either confused about or suspicious of GMOs” (Op-Ed); and prior to doing research on this topic, the members of the group expressed both about GMOs. Therefore, our lack of understanding and our curiosity were the motivating factors for choosing GMOs as our topic for this project. The other reason; genetically modified foods are omnipresent in grocery stores and are very difficult to avoid. Unless a fruit or a vegetable has an organic label, indicating it was not genetically modified, one can assume that when buying foods such as corn, apples, zucchini, canola oil and potatoes, one is buying genetically modified produce. As a result, this topic is personally relevant to all group members and choosing it gave us an opportunity to learn about something that is part of our daily diet. 
                        <br>&emsp; As a result of the controversy amongst researchers ( published studies on the health risks and benefits of the consumption of genetically modified foods), during the research phase of the project, there were several instances where our group came across contradicting studies about the consequences of the consumption of genetically modified foods. There are a multitude of studies that assure the public about the safety of eating genetically modified foods, and yet there is (although significantly less) an unignorable quantity of studies that emphasize the potential health risks associated with long term consumption of aforementioned foods. Although this is more of a cross-roads rathan than a dead-end in our research, we thought it was important to mention this, especially since scientific controversy is an inherent characteristic of our chosen topic.

                           &emsp; The application of the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) as an analysis tool for agricultural GMO technology will help gauge the overall effect of the economic health and sustainability of this practice. GPI is an extension of the traditional economic measurement method of GDP but departs with the incorporation of variants that factor in “resource depletion, housework, volunteer work, long-term environmental damage, unemployment and pollution” (Kelly, Why we need a new way to measure our economy) The inclusion of over 20 factors that are unaccounted for in GDP allows for a more accurate portrayal of the socio-economic effects which can help guide a more educated decision on pursuing a technology in regard to the long-term economic health.. Therefore, the application of GPI provides a more encompassing picture of the economic, social and environmental conditions of employing GMO technology. The information derived from this analysis will provide data on whether further advancement of this technology would deter or promote our sustainable development goals and a supportable earth system.
                           <br> &emsp; Genetic engineering has been a prominent tool employed within the agricultural industry in order to combat challenges currently being faced like an increasing demand from population growth and climate change. This technology allows a gene transfer to “…introduce desirable new genes into an existing plant to achieve herbicidal, insect, frost, or drought resistance” (Guruswamy, 467).This expands the gene pool that was previously limited to the traditional methods of plant breeding in order to achieve desired results through the laws of genetic inheritance. The traditional method could take decades to produce the wanted results but with genetic modification this expedites the process, and the results can be seen within a few years.
                           <br> &emsp; A current issue is exponential population growth and the increasing demand that the agricultural industry tries to meet. GMO technology has been sought out as a response to meet this demand. Genetically modified crops have the capability for greater agricultural yield which would positively impact GPI because “this increase in yields aggregates to a larger supply, which means that the same amount of food and fiber can be grown using less resources such as land, water, and chemicals.” (Zilberman & Holland, Agricultural GMOs).
                           <br> &emsp; Agricultural GMO technology has curated crops that are now resistant to things like herbicides and pests. This can positively impact GPI as it would help lessen the blow of using herbicides on crops because with the application of GMO crops, herbicide use tends to decrease. This can be seen “following the introduction of herbicide resistant canola varieties, from 1995 to 2006, herbicide application rates on canola in western Canada decreased by 53% while the percentage of farmers using zero- or low-tillage rose to 64%” (Zilberman & Holland, Agricultural GMOs). However, the use of GMO technology with the use of herbicide resistant crops doesn’t go unscathed as there is inability to predict the long-term effects of these genetically modified crops in correlation to human consumption and our overall health. There is no current solidified evidence that GMO crops result in specific health. This is a negative impact on the GPI because this expedited process of transferring genes into crops enters new territory and there are likely unforeseeable effects on human health in the future, thus having the ability to adversely affect human capital. Agricultural GMOs are manufactured to possess abilities to be pest resistant. This is within the genetic makeup, therefore, as consumers we are ingesting these products unaware of the potential future physiological effects. The long-term consequences of GMOs need to be taken into consideration because GMOs affect not only human capital but environmental as well.  
                           <br> &emsp; Agricultural GMOs can also negatively impact the GPI because although their goal is to increase yield and lower production costs it is at the expense of biodiversity. Within the agriculture industry there is a reliance on “monoculture, or the cultivation of one crop at a time in a field, resting on a narrow genetic base, and is heavily dependent on pesticides and fertilizer. This has resulted in a severe decline in genetic diversity” (Guruswamy, 474). Therefore, many of these GMO crops would not exist or even survive in the natural environment. The primary focus is short-term consumption and economic growth rather than sustainability.
                           <br> &emsp; GMOs are a great economic proposition because they are helping the agricultural industry reach rising consumer demands with greater yields, but large companies are able to monopolize on these products in relation to GMO seeds or crops; therefore, economically it does seem beneficial. However, when analyzing GMO technology under the GPI, one is required to take into account socio-economic factors not only through a monetary perspective but a sustainable one as well. There are certain aspects to this technology that negatively impact GPI primarily through the unknown long-term effects of agricultural GMO products within the human body and the environment and a concerning decline in genetic diversity. All this has the potential to adversely affect the intricacy of the relationships of plants within the ecosystem as crops intermingle with the natural ecosystem and the overall earth system.

                                    &emsp; Utilizing Franklin’s criteria, we analyse the cultivation and use of genetically modified foods to determine whether this practice is a redemptive one. Franklin's theory of Redemptive Technology is a tool for determining the relative sustainability of any technology or practice. Her model allows one to consider the nature of a technology or practice. A technology or practice is redemptive if it promotes justice, restores reciprocity, confers divisible and indivisible benefits, favours people over machines, maximizes gain (or minimizes disasters), favours conservation over wastes and favours the reversible over the irreversible.
                                    <br> &emsp; By applying Franklin’s second criteria of restoring reciprocity, it can be observed that GM crops can potentially improve the sustainability of agriculture by reducing the use of herbicides, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and enabling sustainable practices of zero tillage.
Tillage and herbicides are often used to prevent unwanted weeds from growing in fields (Zilberman et al. 10). Although herbicides are toxic to most crops, some crops can be made resistant by the means of genetic modification; which allows for herbicide application while the crop is present. Prior to the introduction of herbicide resistant varieties of canola, the primary herbicides used for the crop required tillage for their effectiveness (Smyth, S. J., et al 492). Following this, from 1995 to 2006, herbicide application rates on canola in Canada decreased by 53% while the percentage of farmers using zero- or low-tillage rose to 64%. This significant reduction in the use of herbicides and tillage preserves the quality of the soil, therefore, preventing farmers from exhibiting and excess of GHG emissions caused by harvesting land. Furthermore, tillage greatly relies on the use of fossil fuels, by growing GM crops, this impact to the environment can be significantly reduced. By 2013, the use of herbicide-tolerant canola reduced total GHG emissions by about one billion kilograms of CO2 (Canola Council of Canada 21). Therefore, allowing farmers to increase agricultural sustainability, and simultaneously reduce their environmental footprint. 
                                    <br> &emsp; Furthermore, upon analyzing GM crops by applying Franklin’s third criteria of confer divisible or indivisible benefits, a variety of shared benefits can be observed among society as a whole. GM crops can potentially improve the overall well-being of society by reducing malnutrition. A good example of this potential health benefit of GM crops is corn, which is a major crop grown in Canada. Scientists have been able to genetically modify it to contain 169 times more beta-carotene, six times more Vitamin C, and twice as much folate; and cassava with 30 times more beta-carotene and four times more iron (Zilberman et al. 4). Therefore, providing consumers with greater nutritional benefits than the traditional variety. 
                                    <br> &emsp; By applying Franklin’s fourth criteria of whether a practice favours people over machines, it can be observed that growing GM crops favours the farmers who cultivate them. Rather than replacing human labour with machines, it in fact allows farmers to achieve greater economic efficiencies, by allowing them to adapt to rapidly changing physical growing conditions and global markets. Growing GM crops allows for increased agricultural productivity, which results in greater crop yield, and thus, more income for farmers, which can be spent in the larger economy. It can be argued that the seeds needed for GM crops are rather expensive and so would lower a farmer’s profit. However, in Canada, herbicide-tolerant seeds can be significantly more expensive than conventional seeds, but by utilizing them farmers save time and money by using less herbicide and less fuel for tillage. Between 1996 and 2013, herbicide-tolerant canola in Canada increased yields per hectare by up to 12%, which amounts to nearly 8 million tonnes of additional production. This resulted in an income increase for farmers by an average of $53 per hectare ($21.45 per acre), despite the higher cost of the seed (Canola Council of Canada 14).

                        &emsp; Applying the GPI and redemptive technology analysis tools allow us to better understand the practicality and sustainability of agricultural GMO technology. It has allowed us to consider the economic, environmental and social factors associated with the use of GM crops.
                        <br>&emsp; From analyzing using the GPI, the positive impact to the GPI outweighs the negative. The use of GM crops have the capability for greater agricultural yield, and can lessen the impact to the environment by the reduced use of herbicides. However, agricultural GMOs can negatively impact the GPI at the expense of biodiversity. 
                        <br>&emsp; Further analyzing the use of GM crops using the redemptive technology analysis tool, it can be concluded that the benefits of adapting to the use of GM crops outweigh the negative. The use of GM crops can improve the sustainability of agriculture by reducing the use of herbicides, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and enabling sustainable practices of zero tillage, which can consequently result in less burning of fossil fuel, and therefore restore reciprocity. It also allows farmers to achieve greater economic efficiencies, by allowing them to adapt to rapidly changing physical growing conditions and global markets. It can further favour the masses by providing necessary vitamins and minerals, allowing for a healthier diet. Furthermore, the use of GM crops maximizes gain by improving the time a crop can remain fresh for and also favours the reversible as crops are made more resistant to natural forces.
